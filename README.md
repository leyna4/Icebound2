Game Theme

Icebound is a top down survival game set in a frozen environment.
The ice theme is supported mainly through sound design, not visuals.
Cold ambience, enemy sounds and UI feedback are used to create atmosphere and tension.

Gameplay Mechanics

Player attacks enemies with a sword

Enemies damage the player on contact
